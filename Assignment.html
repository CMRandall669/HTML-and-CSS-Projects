	<h1>How do I feel about dogs?</h1>
	<p>They are the absolute best companion you can find and they will always love you more then you love yourself.</p>
	<h2>They are precious when they want attention</h2>
	<p>They will do anything they can to get you to pay attention to them</p>
	<h6>If you have the chance you should get a dog</h6>
	<p>Why sould you adopt from a rescue?
	<blockquote cite="https://resources.bestfriends.org/article/adopt-pet-shelter-or-rescue">
	Bringing home a new pet is incredibly exciting. And adopting a pet from a shelter or rescue group is not only exciting, but it’s truly a feel-good experience as well. Every day, more than 1,700 dogs and cats are killed in America’s shelters simply because they don’t have safe places to call home. By adopting, it means that each time you look into your pet’s eyes, you can feel good knowing that you truly did save a life.
